#### This repo contains the following:

1. **max_product.py** A module which defines a function to find the maximum product of three integers from a given list of integers. This is accomplished by sorting the list using quicksort algorithm and extracting the three biggest integers from it. The product of the three biggest integers corresponds to the maximun product of three numbers.

2. **test_max_product.py** A script that defines a list with all integers in the range 0-200, then performs one hundred tests with max_product() over shuffled versions of this list. The result of every test is printed out on stdout.
